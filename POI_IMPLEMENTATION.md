# POI Display Feature Implementation

## Overview

This document describes the implementation of the Points of Interest (POI) display feature for the mapscow-mule application.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Layer Visibility Controls
- Added POI visibility toggle to the toolbar layer controls
- POI display is controlled by the `show_pois` field in `GuiState`
- All layer controls (Buildings, Roads, Water, Land, POIs, GPX) are now functional

### 2. POI Detection and Classification
- Implemented `get_poi_type()` method to identify POI nodes from OSM data
- Supports multiple POI categories:
  - **Amenities**: restaurants, cafes, hospitals, schools, banks, fuel stations, etc.
  - **Shops**: supermarkets, bakeries, clothing stores, convenience stores
  - **Tourism**: hotels, attractions, museums, information centers
  - **Leisure**: parks, playgrounds, sports centers
  - **Office**: government buildings, companies
  - **Healthcare**: doctors, dentists
  - **Transport**: public transport stops
  - **Places**: cities, towns, villages

### 3. POI Styling System
- Extended the TOML style configuration to include POI styles
- Added comprehensive POI style definitions in `assets/styles/google-maps.toml`
- Each POI type has configurable color and radius
- Fallback to default style for unmapped POI types

### 4. POI Rendering
- Implemented `draw_pois()` method for rendering POIs on the map
- POIs are rendered as colored circles with configurable radius
- POI labels are displayed at high zoom levels (scale > 50.0)
- Proper rendering order: POIs are drawn after roads but before text labels

### 5. Performance Optimizations
- Visibility culling: only POIs within the visible map bounds are rendered
- Efficient POI type detection using HashMap lookups
- Minimal rendering overhead when POI layer is disabled

## Technical Details

### Code Changes

#### 1. GuiState (`src/gui/mod.rs`)
```rust
pub struct GuiState {
    // ... existing fields ...
    pub show_pois: bool,
    pub show_buildings: bool,
    pub show_roads: bool,
    pub show_water: bool,
    pub show_landuse: bool,
    pub show_gpx: bool,
}
```

#### 2. Toolbar (`src/gui/toolbar.rs`)
Updated layer controls to use actual GuiState fields instead of hardcoded values.

#### 3. MapView (`src/gui/map_view.rs`)
- Updated `show()` method to accept full `GuiState`
- Updated `draw_map()` method to respect layer visibility settings
- Added `draw_pois()` method for POI rendering
- Added `get_poi_type()` method for POI classification
- Added `node_intersects_bounds()` method for visibility culling

#### 4. Style Configuration (`assets/styles/google-maps.toml`)
Added comprehensive POI style definitions with colors and radii for different POI types.

### POI Type Mapping

The system maps OSM tags to POI types as follows:

| OSM Tag | POI Type | Example Values |
|---------|----------|----------------|
| `amenity` | Direct mapping | restaurant, cafe, hospital, school, bank |
| `shop` | `shop_{value}` | shop_supermarket, shop_bakery |
| `tourism` | `tourism_{value}` | tourism_hotel, tourism_museum |
| `leisure` | `leisure_{value}` | leisure_park, leisure_playground |
| `office` | `office_{value}` | office_government, office_company |
| `healthcare` | `healthcare_{value}` | healthcare_doctor, healthcare_dentist |
| `public_transport` | `public_transport` | bus stops, train stations |
| `place` | `place_{value}` | place_city, place_town, place_village |

### Style Configuration Example

```toml
[pois.restaurant]
color = "#e74c3c"
radius = 4.0

[pois.shop_supermarket]
color = "#2ecc71"
radius = 4.0

[pois.tourism_hotel]
color = "#3498db"
radius = 4.0

[pois.default]
color = "#95a5a6"
radius = 2.5
```

## Usage

1. **Toggle POI Display**: Use the "📍 POIs" checkbox in the toolbar to show/hide POIs
2. **Zoom for Labels**: POI names appear when zoom level is high enough (scale > 50.0)
3. **Visual Feedback**: POIs are displayed as colored circles with different colors per category
4. **Styling**: POI appearance can be customized through the TOML style files

## Future Enhancements

### Icon Support (Mentioned in TODO)
The current implementation uses colored circles. Future enhancements could include:
- SVG icon support for different POI types
- Icon scaling based on zoom level
- Maki icons integration (Mapbox icon set)
- Custom icon mapping system

### Enhanced Filtering
- Category-based POI filtering (show only restaurants, shops, etc.)
- Search functionality for POIs
- POI clustering at low zoom levels

### Interaction Features
- Click to select POIs
- POI information tooltips
- POI detail panels

## Testing

The POI feature has been tested with:
- OSM data loading and parsing
- POI visibility toggle functionality
- Multiple POI types and categories
- Style configuration and rendering
- Performance with large datasets

The implementation successfully addresses the TODO item: "POI Display Implementation: Points of Interest are currently not shown on the map" and provides a solid foundation for future POI-related features.
